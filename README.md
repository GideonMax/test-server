# test-server

this is a repo for an annoying bug I'm having
make sure you replace the apiKey in the files with your own key (don't worry, my own key is not in the files)

after downloading/cloning this server, run `npm i` to download the necessary package.<br>


server.js is the server, it is not important.<br>
MapWC.js is the main file, it is a web component for a map, and it is not working properly.<br>
HereTest.js is code I copied from Here's website that also has the same problem.<br>
index.html is the only html file, it has 2 elements in the body:<br>
a g-map (my web component)<br>
and a commented-out div.<br>
uncommenting the div will show the results of the code I copied from Here's website.

please help, I'm desparate
